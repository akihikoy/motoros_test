# MotoPlus(SDK)

The base program of this project, which was copied from:
https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman/tree/kinetic-devel/motoman_driver/MotoPlus

In order to build this project, MotoPlus SDK is needed which is a Motoman-related product from Yaskawa distributed in US and EU, but NOT in Japan.


# MotoPlus(IDE)

This was created by copying MotoPlus(SDK), but is configured to compile with MotoPlus IDE sold in Japan.
Note that MotoPlus IDE in each environment is configured for a specific controller.
Here, YRC1000micro (yrc1000u) is assumed.

Currently, the update of the program is made for MotoPlus(IDE).
